      "question": "Why so many addresses!? What are they?",
      "answer": "Your tnam (transparent address) is publicly known, so staking, voting, tnam to tnam transfers, and anything else done with it can be openly seen and potentially attributed to you. Only transfers can be shielded.<br><br>Your znam (shielded address) can be shared to receive payments. Transfers between znam only reveal transaction details to the sender/receiver involved. Sharing your “viewing key” lets anyone with the viewing key see these details.",

      "answer": "Your private key is usually represented as a 'seed phrase' or 'mnemonic phrase'. It's a list of 12 (or 24) words that give the holder complete control of your address.
